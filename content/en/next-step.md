## What's Next

- **Platform Access and Real User Testing:** Our first priority is getting hands-on access to the live platform. We need to test actual workflows, observe how data loads, and understand the full user journey. Screenshots only show us part of the story. We also need to watch real users' complete real tasks. This means testing with users to simulate usage during different seasons, handling rush orders, and managing compliance deadlines. Next, we will look at what we can and should further improve.
- **Technical Deep Dive:** With platform access, we can assess performance bottlenecks, integration points, and data flow issues that aren't visible in static designs. We'll evaluate how our card system performs with large datasets and identify optimization opportunities.
- **Missing Interface Patterns:** Screenshots revealed modal and form issues, but we haven't seen dashboards, reporting interfaces, or administrative screens. Each interface type needs consistent design patterns and may reveal additional standardization and optimization opportunities.
- **Mobile and Offline Strategy:** We need to test mobile performance and design offline workflows. Agricultural users often have spotty internet, so understanding current offline capabilities and limitations is crucial.
- **Integration and Workflow Analysis:** Agricultural orders involve multiple systems - weather apps, inventory software, compliance platforms, financial systems. Users currently jump between these, re-entering data and losing time during critical seasons. We need to map these workflows and design seamless connections, so information flows automatically between systems instead of requiring manual data entry across multiple platforms.
- **Accessibility and Field Testing:** Real field testing will reveal accessibility needs we can't anticipate from screenshots - things like glare resistance, gloved operation, and voice control requirements.
- **Advanced Features and Automation:** Once we understand the current system capabilities, we can design smart features like predictive ordering, weather integration, and automated compliance tracking.
- **Better Navigation and Filtering:** We should add smart filters that understand farming. Seasonal products get tagged automatically. Emergency orders stand out visually. Users can find what they need without scrolling through huge lists.
- **Improved Data Entry and Validation:** Form validation happens in real-time with clear, helpful messages. Required fields are obvious. Auto-save prevents data loss. Smart defaults speed up common tasks. We included a CSV auto-save icon, but this is a very raw implementation, to load and export common orders to speed up processes.
- **Better Search and Discovery:** A better breakdown of products by category, supplier, or season. Recent searches and favorites make repeat orders faster.
- **Platform-Wide Template System:** We created a reusable layout template that works across all platform pages, but we need to get a better full picture of the platform to create a better standardization, particularly for unique cases of internationalization.

This roadmap starts with understanding what we're really working with, then builds toward a comprehensive agricultural platform that serves users in all conditions and contexts. We are very excited to advance in the next step of this project.
