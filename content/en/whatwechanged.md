- **Made Text Readable and International-Friendly:** We standardized a font size that would make the layout friendly for different languages without losing readability. This helps everyone read better, especially when text gets longer in other languages. We also made input fields flexible, so they don't break when translating to languages that need more space.
- **Replaced Tables with Smart Cards:** The biggest change was switching from rigid tables to flexible cards. Tables forced users to scroll sideways, which is frustrating on any device but impossible on phones. Cards flow naturally and show the most important info first, with details available when you need them.
- **Added Show/Hide for Complex Information:** Not every user needs every detail every time. Essential info like product name and quantity stay visible. Pricing, specs, and compliance details expand when you click. This keeps the screen clean but gives power users access to everything.
- **Smart Filtering for Limited Choices:** For fields with just 2-3 options (like Seasonal/Non-seasonal), we added simple toggle filters instead of dropdown menus. This reduces clicks and makes common choices instantly accessible and intuitive.
- **Visual Cues:** Colors now have specific meanings: green for good/complete, red for urgent/weather-critical, orange for attention needed, blue for informational. This creates a consistent visual language throughout the platform.
- **Smart Priority System:** The interface changes based on what's important. Critical orders get red backgrounds and stay at the top. Normal orders look standard. Completed items fade back, so you focus on what needs attention. Frontend standarization This means consistent spacing, typography, and component behavior whether users are in orders, inventory, or reporting sections.
- **Standardized Loading and Feedback:** We established consistent patterns for how the system communicates with users. Loading states, success confirmations, and error messages now follow the same visual language throughout the platform.
- **Batch Operations for Efficiency:** Large farms need to handle multiple items quickly. We added bulk editing, template creation, and multi-select operations for common workflows.
- **Contrast and Formatting Rules:** We solved contrast issues by establishing clear formatting rules. Text now meets accessibility standards, backgrounds provide proper separation, and important information stands out clearly even in challenging viewing conditions.
- **Standardized Modal Framework:** All pop-up windows now follow consistent rules for size, positioning, and behavior. Headers stay fixed, content scrolls smoothly, and buttons appear in predictable locations. This eliminates confusion and creates muscle memory across different functions.
