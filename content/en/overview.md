# COSMOS Agricultural Design System

This is our first step in developing this design system for COSMOS, based on screenshots and specific feedback about interface problems. While this gave us valuable insights into the current issues - it also means we're working with limited information.

To do our best work, we really need to use the actual platform. We need to click through workflows, test different user scenarios, and see how the system behaves under real conditions. Screenshots can show us layout problems, but they can't reveal how data loads, how errors are handled, or how the system performs during peak usage.

This proposal addresses the specific issues we can see and anticipate, but it's just the starting point. Once we can interact with the live platform, we'll discover additional opportunities for improvement that aren't visible in static images.

The agricultural industry has unique demands - seasonal workflows, compliance requirements, weather dependencies, and field operations. These complexities require hands-on testing to truly understand how the interface should adapt and respond.

What we're presenting here fixes the obvious problems and establishes a solid foundation. But the real design system work begins when we can observe actual users completing real tasks on the live platform.
